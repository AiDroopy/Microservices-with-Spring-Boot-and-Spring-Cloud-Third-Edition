## About the book
Looking to build and deploy microservices but not sure where to start? Check out Microservices with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Cloud, Third Edition.
With a practical approach, you'll begin with simple microservices and progress to complex distributed applications. Learn essential functionality and deploy microservices using Kubernetes and Istio.
This book covers Java 17, Spring Boot 3, and Spring Cloud 2022. Java EE packages are replaced with the latest Jakarta EE packages. Code examples are updated and deprecated APIs have been replaced, providing the most up to date information. Gain knowledge of Spring's AOT module, observability, distributed tracing, and Helm 3 for Kubernetes packaging.
Start with Docker Compose to run microservices with databases and messaging services. Progress to deploying microservices on Kubernetes with Istio. Explore persistence, resilience, reactive microservices, and API documentation with OpenAPI. Learn service discovery with Netflix Eureka, edge servers with Spring Cloud Gateway, and monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and the EFK stack.
By the end, you'll build scalable microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

## Key Takeaways
-	Build reactive microservices using Spring Boot
- Develop resilient and scalable microservices using Spring Cloud
- Use OAuth 2.1/OIDC and Spring Security to protect public APIs
- Implement Docker to bridge the gap between development, testing, and production
- Deploy and manage microservices with Kubernetes
- Apply Istio for improved security, observability, and traffic management
- Write and run automated microservice tests with JUnit, test containers, Gradle, and bash
- Use Spring AOT and GraalVM to native compile the microservices
- Use Micrometer Tracing for distributed tracing

## Outline and Chapter Summary
This book is about building production-ready microservices using Spring Boot 3 and Spring Cloud. This book primarily covers Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, the EFK stack, Prometheus, and Grafana. Each of these open source tools works great by itself, but it can be challenging to understand how to use them together in an advantageous way. In some areas, they complement each other, but in other areas they overlap, and it is not obvious which one to choose for a particular situation.
This is a hands-on book that describes step by step how to use these open source tools together. This is the book I was looking for ten years ago when I started to learn about microservices, but with updated versions of the open source tools it covers.
